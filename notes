Assumptions used in sim:
* a basestation is an antenna location for one generation (LTE,5gNR,mmWave)
* Each basestation has channels with frequency and power (based on the dataset)
* Channels with equal power are the same (for the same basestation)
* basestation functionality affects the probability of channels being available
* Use EPSG:28992 for coordinate system due to convenience of the data gathering (*sigh* difficulty of using WGS84)
* Height is set per basestation(per radio type (5GNR/LTE)) and not per antenna as is sometimes the case.
		The height of the first antenna is used
* Height of user equipment is 1.5 meters for all UE
* shadow fading has mean of 0

TODO:
Manipulate location from x,y (epsg:28992) to lon,lat (wgs84)
